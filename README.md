# DSA-Capstone-Project 2


This repository highlights my capstone project, which I developed in collaboration with the DSA Incubator program. The project is dedicated to analysing data to identify key performance indicators and to create a predictive model that enhances decision-making and drives insights.

I have learnt how to make use of three data analytics tools since the start of the program, namely:

### Data Analytical Tools Used During The Program
- Excel for Data Cleaning. 
- SQL for database management.
- Power BI for data visualisation.

This project aims at using the SQL skills gathered during the DSA Data Analysis class to solve real-life case scenarios, e.g. Actionable insights for strategic decision-making, an efficient system for resource allocation, A clear understanding of gender-related issues within an organisation, etc.


Key features include:

Feature 1: e.g., Interactive dashboards for HR analysis

Feature 2: e.g., Data cleaning and transformation pipelines

Feature 3: e.g., Focus on gender and regional insights

This project demonstrates my skills in SQL and Power BI capabilities in data analysis, data modelling, visualisation, and Power BI development.

## Project Case Study 2: Palmora Group HR Analysis

The Palmoria Group, a manufacturing company based in Nigeria, is embroiled in issues
bordering on gender inequality in its 3 regions. Unfortunately, the media recently
published the news with the headline “Palmoria, the Manufacturing Patriarchy”. This
doesn’t look good for the owners of the business, based on their ambition to scale the
business to other regions and even overseas. Cases like this can only spiral downwards,
revealing other issues like the gender pay gap, amongst other possible issues.

The CEO of Palmoria, Mr Ayodeji Chukwuma, is keen to address these issues before they
get out of hand. The CHRO, Mr Yunus Shofoluwe, has been assigned the task to identify
key areas within the business that could give rise to issues and address them immediately.
Mr Shofoluwe decided to recruit me as an HR Analytics expert to analyse the company’s
HR data and come up with recommendations for management’s attention. “Now, the
future of gender equality in Palmoria lies in your hands” – the exact words of Mr
Shofoluwe before he handed the data to you.

### Required:
- Generally, there are two genders in the organisation. However, some employees
refused to disclose their gender. You would need to assign a generic gender status
to these employees
- Some employees are without a salary because they are no longer with the company.
You will need to take those employees out
- Lastly, some departments are indicated as “NULL”. These departments would also
need to be taken out.

### Pointers from Mr Gamma
1. What is the gender distribution in the organisation? Distil to regions and
departments
2. Show insights on ratings based on gender
3. Analyse the company’s salary structure. Identify if there is a gender pay gap. If
there is, identify the department and regions that should be the focus of
management
4. A recent regulation was adopted which requires manufacturing companies to pay
employees a minimum of $90,000
● Does Palmoria meet this requirement?
● Show the pay distribution of employees grouped by a band of $10,000. For example:
● How many employees fall into a band of $10,000 – $20,000, $20,000 – $30,000,
etc.?
● Also, visualise this by regions

### Case Question
5. Mr Gamma thought to himself that since you were already working on the employee
data, you could help out with allocating the annual bonus pay to employees based on the
performance rating. He handed you another data set that contains rules for making a bonus
payments and asked you to:
● Calculate the amount to be paid as a bonus to individual employees
● Calculate the total amount to be paid to individual employees (salary inclusive of
bonus)
● Total amount to be paid out per region and company-wide

### Tool Used For Case Study 2:
- Power BI
