# DSA-Capstone-Project 1


This repository highlights my capstone project, which I developed in collaboration with the DSA Incubator program. The project is dedicated to analysing data to identify key performance indicators and to create a predictive model that enhances decision-making and drives insights.

I have learnt how to make use of three data analytics tools since the start of the program, namely:

### Data Analytical Tools Used During The Program
- Excel for Data Cleaning. 
- SQL for database management.
- Power BI for data visualisation.

This project aims at using the SQL skills gathered during the DSA Data Analysis class to solve real-life case scenarios, e.g. Actionable insights for strategic decision-making, an efficient system for resource allocation, A clear understanding of gender-related issues within an organisation, etc.


Key features include:

Feature 1: e.g., Interactive dashboards for HR analysis

Feature 2: e.g., Data cleaning and transformation pipelines

Feature 3: e.g., Focus on gender and regional insights

This project demonstrates my skills in SQL and Power BI capabilities in data analysis, data modelling, visualisation, and Power BI development.

## Project Case Study 1: Kultra Mega Stores Inventory

Kultra Mega Stores (KMS), headquartered in Lagos, specialises in office supplies and
furniture. Its customer base includes individual consumers, small businesses (retail), and
large corporate clients (wholesale) across Lagos, Nigeria.

I have been engaged as a Business Intelligence Analyst to support the Abuja division of
KMS. The Business Manager has shared an Excel file containing order data from 2009 to
2012 and has requested that I analyse the data and present your key insights and
findings based on the case scenarios below;

### Case Scenario I
1. Which product category had the highest sales?
2. What are the Top 3 and Bottom 3 regions in terms of sales?
3. What were the total sales of appliances in Ontario?
4. Advise the management of KMS on what to do to increase the revenue from the bottom
10 customers
5. KMS incurred the most shipping cost using which shipping method?

### Case Scenario II
6. Who are the most valuable customers, and what products or services do they typically
purchase?
7. Which small business customer had the highest sales?
8. Which Corporate Customer placed the most number of orders in 2009 â€“ 2012?
9. Which consumer customer was the most profitable one?
10. Which customer returned items, and what segment do they belong to?
11. If the delivery truck is the most economical but the slowest shipping method, and
Express Air is the fastest but the most expensive one. Do you think the company
appropriately spent shipping costs based on the Order Priority? Explain your answer

### Tool Used For Case Study 1:
- SQL Server

### Findings and solutions to both case scenarios;

1. The highest sales product category is Technology
2. The top 3 Regions with the Highest Sales are;
- West with 3,597,549.27
- Ontario	with 3,063,212.47
- Prairie	2,837,304.60
     - While the Bottom 3 Lowest Sales Regions are;
     - Nunavut	with 116,376.48
     - Northwest Territories with 800,847.33
     - Yukon with 975,867.37
3. Total Sales in Ontario are 202,346.83
4. To enhance revenue from the bottom 10 customers, KMS could consider implementing a credit facility along with incentive-based sales promotions. These strategies can empower these customers' purchasing capabilities, ultimately leading to increased revenue from this segment.
5. KMS incurred the most shipping cost using a Delivery Truck	with a total sum of 51,971.93
6.
